# Snap Share

Social networking app that gives users the ability to view, upload
and share their favorite pictures with others. Users also have
the ability to comment on pictures they like (if they've created a profile) while also being able to see who uploaded it.

# Getting Started

Just head over to https://snapshare-nacoda-waschalk.herokuapp.com/ and navigate to Sign Up at the top right of the page to get started.

After you have signed up, you will be redirected to the home page where you will find a link to create a New Post. Once you click New Post, you will then see where you can "Choose File", which is where you will choose whatever picture you would like to share. Then you will be able to write a short description of the photo you have chosen and click Post!. Now your photo is being shared.
